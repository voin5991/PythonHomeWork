class MyObject:
    """
    This class is an example of how to use the __getattribute__ method.

    The __getattribute__ method is called whenever an attribute of an object is accessed.
    In this example, the __getattribute__ method is used to check if the accessed attribute is
    "secret_field" and if the "password" attribute of the object is set to the correct value.
    If both conditions are met, the __getattribute__ method returns a secret value.
    Otherwise, it delegates the attribute access to the original __getattribute__ method of the object.
